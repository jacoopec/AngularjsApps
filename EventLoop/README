Simulates task scheduling with:

Call stack execution

Web API placeholders

Task & microtask prioritization

A spinning arrow representing the event loop tick


 AngularJS only re-renders the DOM when the bound model changes in a way that triggers a digest cycle and affects rendering.


 Add the new item.

Force a re-render of the timeline items.

Then trigger the animation.

Trim the array after animation.

We'll do this using $timeout with a 0-delay to separate the digest cycles.

$timeout(..., 0) lets Angular finish the first digest (rendering the new item).

Then we set vm.animate = true to apply the ng-class.

After the animation finishes, we trim the array and reset the animation flag.
